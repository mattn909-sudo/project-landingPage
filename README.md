# project-landingPage

This project was my first attempt at building a webpage from scratch using both HTML and CSS.
This was good practice using flexbox as well as getting more familiar with CSS functions like rounding corners and styling buttons. On the HTML side this project helped me get more familiar with designing a website in terms how how elements should be contained in order for them to be modified later in CSS. Using flexbox I was able to mimick the design given in the Odin Project literature.
